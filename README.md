BrandedOperatorPanel
====================

The Branded Operator Panel is just a light-weight dashboard for viewing Asterisk/PBX info.

This is currently a heavily customized piece, but should be easy for a developer to adapt to his or her own purposes. A web worker is used to query data. It's presently brought in from a file, but is easily adapted to rest, or something more WebSockety, like Firebase.
